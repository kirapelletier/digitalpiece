	<p>hello, world</p> <!--said Mary. 

Mary was a cheerful girl, very bright-eyed and keen. She had her flaws, though the boys never saw them. There were some little flaws and some enormous. She would forget to take her shoes off at the door, and she would raise her voice at the table. She would put too much salt in the marinade, and she would sit with her legs uncrossed. Once, she kissed a boy and their sweat got on each other in the heat of the July sun. He had parked himself on her swing set and told her very earnestly, “You’re a good one, Mary.” 

She would later think, perhaps, that he had cursed her. What did the world do to good girls with flaws? What the world always did: -->

<!--Mary lived in a little house with a pearly fence and a kitchen overlooking the garden. She had a husband, too, now. His name was Robert, and his well-groomed beard scratched every time he leaned to kiss her over the bubbling marinade. He did that often as of late, because he wanted a baby. There was the awful feeling of weight in her belly, as if it was already there, every time he broached the topic.

“I think,” Robert said today, “I’m going to install a swing set, for the little ones to play on. Yes—right there!” He pointed into the yard.-->

Now Mary blinked and found herself in the center of a nice neighborhood (a good life) but how it lacked any true freedom!
